This is a template we made to save time when going through our Developer Coding Interview homework.

## Setup

This template was initialized using `create-react-app`. You can find some information on how to perform common tasks [here](./DEVELOPMENT.md). Here are the things we added beyond the base configuration of `create-react-app`:

- [Automatic code formatting using Prettier](./DEVELOPMENT.md#formatting-code-automatically)

## Getting started

You should only have to run two commands:

- `yarn start` to start the app. It has live code reloading and other cool stuff baked in.
- `yarn test` to run tests. Tests are not a requirement, feel free to test your code if it saves you time.
